configuration:
  poll_interval_secs:
    name: Poll Interval Seconds
    description: >-
      Determines how frequently the the system is polled so that the fan gets adjusted.
  cooldown_cycles:
    name: Cooldown Cycles
    description: >-
      Determines the amount of polling cycles the fan speed will remain unchanged even if the CPU
      temperature drops. The actual duration will be the `cooldown_cycles * poll_interval_secs`.
  filter_factor:
    name: Filter factor
    description: >-
      Determines how much the latest temperature reading influences the reported CPU temperature.
      Used to filter sudden temperature spikes through the formula:
      `new_temp * filter_factor + (1.0 - filter_factor) * prev_temp`

      A filter_factor of `1.0` means that only the newest reading is used.
  fan_curve:
    name: Fan Curve
    description: >-
      Strictly ascending list of fan curve points comprising of temperatures and fan speed percentages.
